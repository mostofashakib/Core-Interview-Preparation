"""
Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices
such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering.

Things to note:
    Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
    Topological Sort orderings are not unique
    Topological Sort is used to solve real-world problems such as course scheduling problem, item-assembly

Algorithm: Targan's Topological Sort: Modified Depth-First-Search
    We recursively call topologicalSort for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. Finally, print contents of stack.
    Note that a vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are visited.

Algorithm: Kahnâ€™s algorithm
    Step 1: Compute in-degree (number of incoming edges) for each of the vertex present in the DAG and initialize the count of visited nodes as 0.
    Step 2: Pick all the vertices with in-degree as 0 and add them into a queue (Enqueue operation)
    Step 3: Remove a vertex from the queue (Dequeue operation) and then.
                Increment count of visited nodes by 1.
                Decrease in-degree by 1 for all its neighboring nodes.
                If in-degree of a neighboring nodes is reduced to zero, then add it to the queue.
    Step 4: Repeat Step 3 until the queue is empty.
    Step 5: If count of visited nodes is not equal to the number of nodes in the graph then the topological sort is not possible for the given graph.
